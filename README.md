# Selenium Automated Test – Change Password (F6: Account Information Update)

This repository contains an automated test script developed for **Assignment 3: System Test** of the *eCommerce Playground* website, hosted on [LambdaTest](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io).

---

## Overview
The Python Selenium script tests the **Change Password** process for an existing user account under the function **F6 – Account Information Update**.

The goal is to validate that:
1. The system displays an inline validation error when mismatched passwords are entered.  
2. The password update succeeds when matching values are entered.  
3. The old password becomes invalid, and the new password allows successful login.
